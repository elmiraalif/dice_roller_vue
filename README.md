# Dice Roller

This is a very basic dice roller created in Vue CLI.

- There are 2 players in this game. Once the dice roller button gets clicked, both dices will show a random number. The result will depend on the dice number. The player whose number is greater wins and if the dice numbers are the same, the game will be a draw!
- Once the roll happens, the user can start a new game by clicking on the same button which, now, has the title of "New Game", and the game begins!
